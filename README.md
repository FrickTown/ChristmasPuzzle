# Julklapp
Sliding puzzle gimmick for a christmas gift.

Designed for touch interaction only, and styled for mobile use, so if you are for some reason trying to view the demo, 
open [the demo](imfalling.github.io/Julklapp) on your phone, or use the touchscreen device simulation tool in dev settings on chrome/firefox.

Code is very (VERY) crude, but it works. For now.
(I promise I can do better)

Merry Christmas
